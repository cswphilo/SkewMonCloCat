- What is new?

Repeat that (skew) monoidal closed is complicated compared to just monoidal
or just closed.

- Why is this important?

Do we have a motivation for this logic from logic point of view?

- For things given without proof, let's mention they are all proved in
  the formalization.

- Sort out terminology around focusing: what do we use, is there a name,
  Tarmo checks Pinto, Dyckhoff stuff

- Explicitly show impossibility of the required derivations in the
  para just before Sec 4.2

- Revisit the same examples and show derivations in the para just
  before Thm 4.1

- Say something more informative about multifocusing.

- Explain that contexts have an untagged part followed by a tagged
  part, this is an invariant in our derivations.
