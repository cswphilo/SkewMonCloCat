  Monoidal closed categories are used as standard categorical models of intuitionistic noncommutative linear logic: the monoidal unit and tensor model the multiplicative unit and conjunction; the internal hom models linear implication. In recent years, the weaker notion of skew monoidal closed category has been proposed by Ross Street, where the three structural laws of left and right unitality and associativity are not required to be invertible, they are merely natural transformations with a specific orientation. A question arises naturally: Is it possible to find logical proof systems which are naturally modelled by skew monoidal closed categories? We answer positively by introducing three equivalent deductive systems that serve the purpose: a Hilbert-style calculus; a cut-free sequent calculus; a calculus of normal forms obtained from an adaptation of Andreoli's focusing technique to our skew setting. The resulting focused sequent calculus peculiarly employs a system of tags for keeping track of new formulae appearing in the antecedent and appropriately reducing nondeterministic choices in proof search. Focusing solves the coherence problem for skew monoidal closed categories, which implies the existence of effective procedures for deciding equality of canonical morphisms in all models.

%%   In previous works from Uustalu et al, proof theory of some variants of skew monoidal categories are developed.
%%   We also know that given a skew monoidal category, there is a corresponding skew closed structure on the same category.
%%   It motivates us to develop a proof theory of such skew monoidal closed structures and see its meta properties.
%%
%%   In this paper, a Hilbert-style categorical calculus, a cut-free sequent calculus, and a tagged focused sequent calculus are presented.
%%   We prove the soundness and completeness between categorical calculus and sequent calculus.
%%   Moreover any two equivalent proofs from cut-free sequent calculus are mapped into same derivation in tagged focused calculus.
%%   Therefore we have an effective procedure to determine morphism existence and equivalence in skew monoidal closed categories.

\section{Introduction}
It is a well-known fact from the late 80s/early 90s that symmetric monoidal closed categories are standard categorical models of \MILL, multiplicative intuitionistic linear logic, whose logical connectives comprise of multiplicative unit $\I$ and conjunction $\ot$ and linear implication $\lolli$ \cite{mellies:categorical:09}. Probably lesser-known, though a quite straightforward generalization of the previous sentence which actually predated the inception of linear logic altogether, is the fact that (non-necessarily symmetric) monoidal biclosed categories are categorical models of the noncommutative variant of \MILL\ (for which we use the abbreviation \NMILL) \cite{abrusci:noncommutative:1990}, where the structural rule of exchange is absent and there are two ordered implications $\lolli$ and $\illol$ \cite{lambek:deductive:68}. A proof system for \NMILL\ is typically called \emph{Lambek calculus}. Lambek refers to the implications $\lolli$ and $\illol$ as residuals, and models of Lambek calculus are thereupon called residual categories. The Lambek calculus is often practically employed in formal investigations of natural languages \cite{lambek:mathematics:58}.
By dropping one of the ordered implication of \NMILL\ one obtains a fragment of the Lambek calculus enjoying categorical semantics in every monoidal closed category.

In recent years, Ross Street introduced the new notion of skew monoidal closed categories \cite{street:skew-closed:2013}. These are a weakening of monoidal closed categories: their structure includes a unit $I$, a tensor $\ot$, an internal hom $\lolli$ and an adjunction relating the latter two operations, as in usual non-skew monoidal categories. The difference lays in the three structural laws of left and right unitality, $\lambda_A : \I \ot A \to A$ and $\rho_A : A \to A \ot \I$, and associativity, $\alpha_{A,B,C} : (A \ot B) \ot C \to A \ot (B \ot C)$, which are usually required to be natural isomorphisms, but in the skew variant are merely natural transformations with the specified orientation. Street originally proposed this weaker notion for better understanding and fixing a famous imbalance, first noticed by Eilenberg and Kelly \cite{eilenberg:closed:1966}, found in the usual adjunction relating monoidal and closed structures \cite{street:skew-closed:2013,uustalu:eilenberg-kelly:2020}. In the last decade, skew monoidal closed categories, together with their non-closed/non-monoidal variants, have been thoroughly studied, with applications ranging from algebra and homotopy theory to programming language semantics \cite{szlachanyi:skew-monoidal:2012,lack:skew:2012,lack:triangulations:2014,altenkirch:monads:2014,buckley:catalan:2015,bourke:skew:2017,bourke:skew:2018,tomita:realizability:21}.

A question arises naturally: is it possible to characterize skew monoidal closed categories as standard categorical models of a certain logical proof system, e.g. a skew variant of \NMILL?
This paper provides a positive answer to this question. We introduce a cut-free sequent calculus for a skew variant of \NMILL, which we name (rather unoriginally) \SkNMILL. Sequents are peculiarly defined as triples $S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$, where the succedent is a single formula $A$ (as in intuitionistic linear logic), but the antecedent is split in two parts: an optional formula $S$, called \emph{stoup} \cite{girard:constructive:91}, and an ordered list of formulae $\Gamma$. Inference rules are similar to the ones of \NMILL\ but with specific structural restrictions for accurately capturing the structural laws of skew monoidal closed categories, and nothing more. In particular, and in analogy with \NMILL, the structural rules of contraction, weakening and exchange are all absent. Sets of derivations are quotiented by a congruence relation $\circeq$, carefully chosen to serve as the proof-theoretic counterpart of the equational theory of skew monoidal closed categories. The design of the sequent calculus draws inspiration from, and further advance, the line of work of Uustalu, Veltri and Zeilberger on proof systems for various categories with skew structure: skew semigroup (a.k.a. Tamari order) \cite{zeilberger:semiassociative:19}, skew monoidal (non-closed) \cite{uustalu:sequent:2021,uustalu:proof:nodate} and its symmetric variant \cite{veltri:coherence:2021}, skew prounital (non-monoidal) closed \cite{uustalu:deductive:nodate}.

The metatheory of \SkNMILL\ is developed in two different but related directions:
\begin{enumerate}[($i$)]
  \item We study the categorical semantics of \SkNMILL, by showing that the cut-free sequent calculus admits an interpretation of formulae, derivations and equational theory $\circeq$ in every skew monoidal closed category. Moreover, the sequent calculus is \emph{canonical} among skew monoidal closed categories, in the sense that it gives a particular presentation of the \emph{initial} (also called \emph{term} or \emph{free}) model. This can be made precise by introducing a Hilbert-style calculus which directly represents the initial model and subsequently proving that derivations in the two calculi are in a bijective correspondence.
This shows that the categorical semantics of \SkNMILL\ is sound and, most importantly, complete. The latter fact implies that deciding the commutativity of a diagram made of canonical morphisms (i.e. structural laws) in an arbitrary skew monoidal category, a problem typically referred to as \emph{coherence} in the categorical literature, is reduced to checking whether the corresponding derivations in the sequnt calculus are $\circeq$-related.

\item We investigate the proof-thereoretic semantics of \SkNMILL, by defining a normalization strategy for sequent calculus derivations wrt. the congruence $\circeq$, when the latter is considered as weakly confluent and strongly normalizing reduction relation. The shape of normal forms is made explicit in a new \emph{focused} sequent calculus, whose derivations act as targets of the normalization procedure. The sequent calculus is ``focused'' in the sense of Andreoli \cite{andreoli:logic:1992}, as it implements a sound and complete goal-directed proof search strategy attempting to build a derivation in the (original, unfocused) sequent calculus. The focused system in this paper extends the previously
developed normal forms for skew monoidal (non-closed) categories \cite{uustalu:sequent:2021,uustalu:proof:nodate}. The presence of both positive ($\I$,$\ot$) and negative ($\lolli$) connectives requires some extra care in the implementation of the proof search algorithm, which is reflected in the design of the focused sequent calculus, in particular when aiming at removing all possible nondeterministic choices (wrt. the conversion $\circeq$) that can arise during proof search. This is technically realized in the focused sequent calculus by the peculiar employment of a system of \emph{tags} for keeping track of new formulae appearing in the antecedent. The focused sequent calculus can also be seen as a concrete presentation of the initial model for \SkNMILL, and as such can be used for solving the coherence problem in an effective fashion: deciding commutativity of canonical diagrams in arbitrary skew monoidal categories is equivalent to deciding the \emph{syntactic} equality of the corresponding focused derivations.
\end{enumerate}

%% Srtucture of the paper?
%%
%% Recent discoveries on skew monoidal categories \cite{szlachanyi:skew-monoidal:2012} \cite{lack:skew:2012} \cite{lack:triangulations:2014} (check references in previous papers, at least include papers cited by previous three papers) provide us a good reasons to study their corresponding proof systems.
%% In previous work \cite{uustalu:sequent:2021} \cite{uustalu:deductive:nodate} \cite{uustalu:proof:nodate} \cite{veltri:coherence:2021}, sequent calculus proof system for skew monoidal categories, prounital closed categories, partial normal monoidal categories, and skew symmetric monoidal categories are presented respectively.
%% However, there is still lack of a proof analysis on skew monoidal closed categories.
%% Therefore, in this paper we give sound and complete sequent calculus system with skew monoidal closed categories.
%% Moreover, we use focusing strategy from \cite{andreoli:logic:1992} to solve the coherence problem of skew monoidal closed categories.
%%
%% Interestingly, because of having two connectives in our sequent calculus system, the focusing strategy becomes subtle and involved.

\section{A Sequent Calculus for Skew Noncommutative \MILL}\label{sec2}
In this section we introduce the sequent calculus for our skew variant of noncommutative multiplicative linear logic (\NMILL), that we call \SkNMILL.

Formulae are inductively generated by the grammar $A,B ::= X \ | \ \I \ | \ A \ot B \ | \ A \lolli B$, where $X$ comes from a fixed set $\mathsf{At}$ of atomic formulae (or propositional variables), $\I$ is a multiplicative unit, $\ot$ is a multiplicative tensor (or conjunction) and $\lolli$ is a linear implication.

Sequents are triples of the form $S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$, where the succendent $A$ is a single formula (as in \NMILL), but the antecedents is divided in two parts: an optional formula $S$, called \emph{stoup} \cite{girard:constructive:91}, and an ordered list of formulae $\Gamma$, called \emph{context}. The peculiar design of sequents, involving the presence of the stoup in the antecedent, comes from previous work on deductive systems with skew structure by Uustalu, Veltri and Zeilberger \cite{uustalu:sequent:2021,uustalu:proof:nodate,uustalu:deductive:nodate,veltri:coherence:2021}.
We reserve the metavariable $S$ to denote a stoup, i.e. $S$ which could be a single formula or empty, in which case we write $S = -$. Atomic formulae will always be names $X,Y,Z$.

Derivations of a sequent $S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$ are inductively generated by the following rules:
%\begin{defn}
%  \emph{SkNMILL} is a sequent calculus system whose sequents are in the form of $S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$ coustructed with following rules
\begin{equation}\label{eq:seqcalc}
  \def\arraystretch{2.5}
  \begin{array}{c}
    \infer[\ax]{A \mid \quad \vdash A}{}
    \qquad
    \infer[\pass]{- \mid A , \Gamma \vdash C}{A \mid \Gamma \vdash C}
    \qquad
    \infer[\lleft]{A \lolli B \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vdash C}{
      - \mid \Gamma \vdash A
      &
      B \mid \Delta \vdash C
    }
    \qquad
    \infer[\lright]{S \mid \Gamma \vdash A \lolli B}{S \mid \Gamma , A \vdash B}
    \\
    \infer[\unitl]{\I \mid \Gamma \vdash C}{- \mid \Gamma \vdash C}
    \qquad
    \infer[\tl]{A \ot B \mid \Gamma \vdash C}{A \mid B , \Gamma \vdash C}
    \qquad
    \infer[\unitr]{- \mid \quad \vdash \I}{}
    \qquad
    \infer[\tr]{S \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vdash A \ot B}{
      S \mid \Gamma \vdash A
      &
      - \mid \Delta \vdash B
    }
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
%\end{defn}


%\niccolo{
%  Explain what the rules do, e.g. when read bottom-up, and what are the differences from the non-skew case
%}

The inference rules in (\ref{eq:seqcalc}) are reminiscent of the ones in the sequent calculus for \NMILL\ \cite{abrusci:noncommutative:1990}, but there are some crucial differences.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The left logical rules $\unitl$, $\tl$ and $\lleft$, read bottom-up, are only allowed to be applied on the formula in the stoup position. In particular, there is no general way to remove a unit $\I$ nor decompose a tensor $A \ot B$ if these formulae are located in the context and not in the stoup (we will see in (\ref{eq:lleft:gen}) that something can actually be done to deal with implications $A \lolli B$ in the context).
\item The right tensor rule $\tr$, read bottom-up, moves the formula in the stoup, in case such a formula is present, to the stoup of the first premise. In other words, if there is a formula $A'$ in the stoup of the conclusion, after the application of $\tr$ it is not possible to move $A'$ to the antecedent of the second premise.
\item The presence of the stoup implies a distinction between antecedents of the form $A \mid \Gamma$ and $- \mid \Gamma$. The structural rule $\pass$ (for `passivation`), read bottom-up, allows the moving of the leftmost formula in the context to the stoup position, whenever the stoup is initially empty.
\item The logical connectives of \NMILL\ typically include two ordered implications $\lolli$ and $\illol$, which are two variants of linear implication arising from the removal of the exchange rule from intuitionistic linear logic. In \SkNMILL\ only one of the ordered implications is present. It is currently not clear to us whether the inclusion of the second implication to the logic is meaningful and it corresponds to some particular categorical notion.
\end{enumerate}
The restrictions in 1--4 are essential for precisely capturing all the features of skew monoidal closed categories and nothing more, as we discuss in Section \ref{sec:catsem}.
Notice also that, similarly to the case of \NMILL, all structural rules of exchange, contraction, and weakening are absent. We give names to derivations and we write $f : S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$ or $S \mid \Gamma \stackrel{f}{\vdash} A$ when $f$ is a particular derivations of the sequent $S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$.

Examples of valid derivations in the sequent calculus, corresponding to structural laws $\lambda$, $\rho$ and $\alpha$ of skew monoidal closed categories (see Definition \ref{def:skewcat}), are given below. %which will help us  understanding the connection with skew monoidal closed categories.
%If we interpret morphism $A \Longrightarrow C$ as a sequent $A \mid \quad \vdash C$, then we can see the natural transformations are derivable in this sequent calculus.
%For example, natural transformations $\lambda : \I \ot A \Longrightarrow A , \rho : A \Longrightarrow A \ot \I$, and $\alpha : (A \ot B) \ot C \Longrightarrow A \ot (B \ot C)$ in skew monoidal closed categories are admissible in SkNMILL:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lra}
  \begin{array}{c@{\;\quad}cc}
  (\lambda) & (\rho) & (\alpha) \\
  \infer[\tl]{\I \ot A \mid \quad \vdash A}{
    \infer[\unitl]{\I \mid A \vdash A}{
      \infer[\pass]{ \mid A \vdash A}{
        \infer[\ax]{A \mid \quad \vdash A}{}
      }
    }
  }
  &
  \infer[\tr]{A \mid \quad \vdash A \ot \I}{
    \infer[\ax]{A \mid \quad \vdash A}{}
    &
    \infer[\unitr]{- \mid \quad \vdash \I}{}
  }
  &
  \infer[\tl]{(A \ot B) \ot C \mid \quad \vdash A \ot (B \ot C)}{
    \infer[\tl]{A \ot B \mid C \vdash A \ot (B \ot C)}{
      \infer[\tr]{A \mid B , C \vdash A \ot (B \ot C)}{
        \infer[\ax]{A \mid \quad \vdash A}{}
        &
        \infer[\pass]{- \mid B , C \vdash B \ot C}{
          \infer[\tr]{B \mid C \vdash B \ot C}{
            \infer[\ax]{B \mid \quad \vdash B}{}
            &
            \infer[\pass]{- \mid C \vdash C}{
              \infer[\ax]{C \mid \quad \vdash C}{}
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
Examples of non valid sequents include the ``inverses'' of the goals in (\ref{eq:lra}), obtained by swapping the stoup formula with the succedent formula.
%Another important thing is that SkNMILL could not prove the inverse of any natural transformations above.
The three sequents $X \mid ~ \vdash \I \ot X$, $X \ot \I \mid ~ \vdash X$ and $X \ot (Y \ot Z) \mid ~ \vdash (X \ot Y) \ot Z$ have no derivations. All possible attempts of constructing a valid proof for each of them end in failure.
\begin{displaymath}
  \begin{array}{ccc}
  (\lambda^{-1}) & (\rho)^{-1} & (\alpha^{-1}) \\[6pt]
    \infer[\tr]{X \mid ~\vdash \I \ot X}{
      \deduce[??]{X \mid ~ \vdash \I}{
      }
      &
      \deduce[??]{- \mid ~ \vdash X}{
      }
    }
    &
    \infer[\tl]{X \ot \I \mid \quad \vdash X}{
      \deduce{X \mid \I \vdash X}{??}
    }
    &
    \infer[\tl]{X \ot (Y \ot Z) \mid ~\vdash (X \ot Y) \ot Z}{
      \deduce{X \mid Y \ot Z \vdash (X \ot Y) \ot Z}{??}
    } \\
    (\text{$\tr$ sends $X$ to 1st premise}) &
    (\text{$\unitl$ does not act on $\I$ in context}) &
    (\text{$\tl$ does not act on $\ot$ in context})
  \end{array}
\end{displaymath}
% We interpret $\rho^{-1}$ into $A \ot \I \mid \quad \vdash A$, then according to bottom-up proof search strategy, we first apply $\tl$ but we get stuck immediately.
% Therefore, $\rho^{-1}$ is not derivable in our sequent calculus.
% Other cases are similar.
% In categorical semantics section we will see more details about relationship between SkNMILL and free skew monoidal closed categories.
For analogous reasons, the sequents $\I \lolli A \mid ~ \vdash A$ and $(A \ot B) \lolli C \mid ~ \vdash A \lolli (B \lolli C)$ are valid, while generally their ``inverses'' are not. Moreover, one can turn a derivation of $A \mid ~ \vdash B$ into a derivation of $\I \mid ~ \vdash A \lolli B$, but it is impossible to find a derivation of $X \mid ~ \vdash Y$ from a derivation of $\I \mid ~ \vdash X \lolli Y$.


Sets of derivations are quotiented by a congruence relation $\circeq$, generated by the pairs of derivations in Figure \ref{fig:circeq}. The first three equations are $\eta$-conversions, completely characterizing the $\ax$ rule on non-atomic formulae. The remaining equations are permutative conversions. The congruence $\circeq$ has been carefully chosen to serve as the proof-theoretic counterpart of the equational theory of skew monoidal closed categories, introduced in Definition \ref{def:skewcat}. The subsystem of equations involving only $(\I,\ot)$ originated from \cite{uustalu:sequent:2021}, while the subsystem involving only $\lolli$ comes from \cite{uustalu:deductive:nodate}.

The sequent calculus admits cut admissibility.
\begin{theorem}
Two cut rules are admissible %in sequent calculus system for skew monoidal closed categories. $\mathsf{scut}$ and $\mathsf{ccut}$
  \begin{displaymath}
    \infer[\mathsf{scut}]{S \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vdash C}{
      S \mid \Gamma \vdash A

      A \mid \Delta \vdash C

\begin{proof}
  According to previous works \cite{uustalu:sequent:2021} and \cite{uustalu:deductive:nodate} we know two cut rules, $\mathsf{scut}$ and $\mathsf{ccut}$ are admissible in each system separately.
  As our new sequent calculus system is a union of two previous systems, we can just check the $\ot$ and $\lolli$ interaction cases.

  Dealing with $\mathsf{scut}$ first, same as proof strategy in previous papers, we proof by induction on left premise of $\mathsf{scut}$ rule.
  \begin{enumerate}[1. ]
    \item First case is $\mathsf{scut} \text{ } ((\tl \text{ } f), g)$ where $f : A' \mid B' , \Gamma \vdash A, g : A \mid \Delta \vdash C$, then we do subinduction on $g$ to obtain two subcases:
          \begin{enumerate}[a. ]
            \item $g = \lright \text{ } g'$, then we let $\mathsf{scut} \text{ } ((\tl \text{ } f), (\lright \text{ } g')) \defeq \lright \text{ } (\mathsf{scut} \text{ } ((\tl \text{ } f), g'))$.
            \item $g = \lleft \text{ } g'$, then we let $\mathsf{scut} \text{ } ((\tl \text{ } f), (\lright \text{ } g')) \defeq \tl \text{ } (\mathsf{scut} \text{ } (f, (\lright \text{ } g')))$
          \end{enumerate}
    \item $\mathsf{scut} \text{ } ((\lleft f \text{ } (f' , f'')), g)$, where $f' : - \mid \Gamma' \vdash A'$, $f'' : B' \mid \Gamma'' \vdash A$, and $g : A \mid \Delta \vdash C$.
    This case is similar as $\mathsf{scut} \text{ } ((\tl \text{ } f), g)$.
    \item There is no new case for premise is from $\tr$ or $\lright$, because cut formulae are not matched.
  \end{enumerate}
  Next we see the cut-freeness of $\mathsf{ccut}$ rule.
  Similarly, we prove it by induction on the second premise.
  \begin{enumerate}[1. ]
    \item $\mathsf{ccut} \text{ } (f , (\lleft \text{ } (g, h)))$ where $f : - \mid \Gamma \vdash A$, $g : - \mid \Delta_1 \vdash A'$, $h : B' \mid \Delta_2 \vdash C$, then we do subinduciton on $f$:
    \begin{enumerate}[a. ]
      \item The only possibility is $A = A' \ot B'$ and $f = \tr (f_1, f_2)$ where $f_1 : - \mid \Gamma_1 \vdash A'$, $f_2 : - \mid \Gamma_2 \vdash B'$, then depending on $A' \ot B'$ in $\Delta_1$ or $\Delta_2$,
      we let $\mathsf{ccut} \text{ } (f , (\lleft \text{ } (g, h))) \defeq \lleft \text{ } (\mathsf{ccut} \text{ } (f, g), h)$ or $ \lleft \text{ } (g, (\mathsf{ccut} \text{ } (f, h)))$, respectively.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item $\mathsf{ccut} \text{ } (f , (\tr \text{ } (g, h)))$ where $f : - \mid \Gamma \vdash A$, $g : S \mid \Delta_1 \vdash A'$, $h : - \mid \Delta_2 \vdash B'$ is similar as above.
    \item $\mathsf{ccut} \text{ } (f, (\tl \text{ } g))$ and
    $\mathsf{ccut} \text{ } (f, (\lright \text{ } h))$ cases are similar, we permute $\mathsf{ccut}$ up,
    where $g : A' \mid B' , \Delta_0 , A , \Delta_1 \vdash C$, $h : S \mid \Delta_0 , A , \Delta_1 , A' \vdash B'$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
The two cut rule satisfy a large number of
$\circeq$-equations, see e.g.~\cite[Figures 5 and 6]{uustalu:sequent:2021} for the
list of such equations not involving $\lolli$.
Other important admissible rules are listed below.
\begin{itemize}
\item The left rules for $\I$ and $\ot$ are invertible wrt. $\circeq$, and similarly the right rule for $\lolli$. This in particular implies the admissibility of the following rules:
\begin{displaymath}
  \infer[\tl^{-1}]{A \mid B, \Gamma \vdash C}{A \ot B \mid \Gamma \vdash C}
  \qquad
  \infer[\unitl^{-1}]{- \mid \Gamma \vdash C}{\I \mid \Gamma \vdash C}
  \qquad
  \infer[\lright^{-1}]{S \mid \Gamma , A \vdash B}{S \mid \Gamma \vdash A \lolli B}
\end{displaymath}
Notice that no other rule is invertible, and in particular not the
passivation rule $\pass$.

\item Applications of the invertible left logical rules can be iterated, and similarly for the invertible right $\lright$ rule, resulting in the two admissible rules
\begin{equation}\label{eq:inter:ante}
  \infer[\mathsf{L}^\star]{\ldbc S \mid \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot} \mid \Delta \vdash C}{
    S \mid \Gamma ,\Delta \vdash C
  }
  \qquad
  \infer[\lright^\star]{S \mid \Gamma \vdash \ldbc \Delta \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli}}{
    S \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vdash C
  }
\end{equation}
The interpretation of antecedents $\ldbc S \mid \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot}$ in (\ref{eq:inter:ante}) is the formula obtained by subtituting the separator $\mid$ and the commas with tensors: $\ldbc S \mid A_1,\dots,A_n \rdbc_{\ot} = (\dots ((\ldbc S \llangle \ot A_1) \ot A_2) \dots ) \ot A_n$, where $\ldbc - \llangle = \I$ and $\ldbc A \llangle = A$.
% as $\ldbc S \mid \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot} = \ldbc S \llangle \text{ } \llangle \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot}$, where
% \begin{align*}
%   \ldbc - \llangle = \I \qquad \ldbc A \llangle = A \quad\qquad A \llangle \text{ } \rdbc_{\ot} = A \qquad A \llangle B , \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot} = (A \ot B ) \llangle \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot}
% \end{align*}
% In other words, $\ldbc S \mid A_1,\dots,A_n \rdbc_{\ot} = (\dots ((\ldbc S \llangle \ot A_1) \ot A_2) \dots ) \ot A_n$.
Dually, the formula $\ldbc \Delta \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli}$ in (\ref{eq:inter:ante}) is obtained by substituting $\mid$ and commas with implications:
% \begin{displaymath}
%   \ldbc \quad \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli} = C \qquad \ldbc A , \Gamma \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli} = A \lolli \ldbc \Gamma \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli}
% \end{displaymath}
$\ldbc A_1,\dots,A_n \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli} = A_1 \lolli (A_2 \lolli (\dots \lolli (A_n \lolli C)))$.

\item Another left implication rule, acting on a formula $A \lolli B$ in the context, is derivable using cut:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lleft:gen}
    \!\!\!
  \proofbox{
    \infer[\lleft_{\mathsf{C}}]{S \mid \Delta_0, A \lolli B, \Gamma , \Delta_1 \vdash C}{
      - \mid \Gamma \stackrel{f}{\vdash} A
      &
      S \mid \Delta_0, B , \Delta_1 \stackrel{g}{\vdash} C
    }
  }
  {=}
  \proofbox{
    \infer[\mathsf{ccut}]{S \mid \Delta_0, A \lolli B, \Gamma , \Delta_1 \vdash C}{
      \infer[\pass]{- \mid A \lolli B, \Gamma \vdash B}{
        \infer[\lleft]{A \lolli B \mid \Gamma \vdash B}{
          - \mid \Gamma \stackrel{f}{\vdash} A
          &
          \infer[\ax]{B \mid ~ \vdash B}{}
        }
      }
      &
      S \mid \Delta_0, B , \Delta_1 \stackrel{g}{\vdash} C
    }
  }
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

% There are some useful rules are admissible in SkNMILL.
% \begin{remark}
%   Following rules are admissible in SkNMILL:
%   \begin{displaymath}
%     \infer{\ldbc S \mid \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot} \mid \Delta \vdash C}{
%       S \mid \Gamma ,\Delta \vdash C
%     }
%     \qquad
%     \infer{S \mid \Gamma \vdash \ldbc \Delta \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli}}{
%       S \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vdash C
%     }
%     \qquad
%     \infer{S \mid \Delta_0, A \lolli B, \Gamma , \Delta_1 \vdash C}{
%       - \mid \Gamma \vdash A
%       &
%       S \mid \Delta_0, B , \Delta_1 \vdash C
%     }
%   \end{displaymath}
%   Inductive definitions of formulae $\ldbc A \mid \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot}$ (defined as $\ldbc S \mid \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot} = \ldbc S \llangle \text{ } \llangle \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot}$) and $\ldbc \Gamma \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli}$ are originated from \cite{uustalu:sequent:2021} and \cite{uustalu:deductive:nodate} respectively:
%   \begin{align*}
%     \ldbc - \llangle = \I \qquad \ldbc A \llangle = A \quad\qquad A \llangle \text{ } \rdbc_{\ot} = A \qquad A \llangle B , \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot} = (A \ot B ) \llangle \text{ } \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot}
%   \end{align*}
%   \begin{displaymath}
%     \ldbc \quad \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli} = C \qquad \ldbc A , \Gamma \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli} = A \lolli \ldbc \Gamma \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli}
%   \end{displaymath}
% \end{remark}

%SkNMILL is a cut-free calculus so we are in a good shape and could discuss more about its correspondence with categorical structures.

%\niccolo{The above proof is interesting, but also quite long. We could move this to the Appendix if we need to make some room in the main text.
%}

%\niccolo{
%  We should mention (in a Proposition?) that some other rules are admissible: inverses of $\unitl$, $\tl$ and $\lright$ (and these are the only invertible ones, in particular $\pass$ is not invertible), and also:
%  \[
%  \infer{\ldbc S \mid \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot} \mid \Delta \vdash C}{
%    S \mid \Gamma ,\Delta \vdash C
%  }
%  \qquad
%  \infer{S \mid \Gamma \vdash \ldbc \Delta \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli}}{
%    S \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vdash C
%  }
%  \qquad
%    - \mid \Gamma \vdash A
%    &
%    S \mid \Delta_0, B , \Delta_1 \vdash C
%  }
%  \]
%  The last one using cut. So we could introduce the definitions of $\ldbc S \mid \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot}$ and $\ldbc \Delta \mid C \rdbc_{\lolli}$ at this point.
%  }

%%We have a cut-free proof theory which characterizes skew monoidal closed categories nicely so far.
%%According to Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence, we can interpret morphisms in skew monoidal closed categories as derivations in the sequent calculus system.
%%This fact allows us to tackle problems in skew monoidal closed categories by methods in proof theory.
%%In particular, we will use Andreoli's focusing technique \cite{andreoli:logic:1992} to analyze and solve coherence problem of skew monoidal closed categories.

\section{Categorical Semantics via Skew Monoidal Closed Categories}
\label{sec:catsem}

%\niccolo{
%I don't think we should give the definition of skew monoidal closed category using all these structural laws and equations, since we know that it can be done with much less (and all this structure takes a lot of room!). I suggest following the definition given in \cite{uustalu:eilenberg-kelly:2020}, using $\lambda$, $\rho$ and $\alpha$ (it is enough to state that there is an adjunction, no need to show $\eta/\epsilon$ nor $p/\mathsf{M}$). Afterwards we can comment on the fact that the definition can equivalently be stated using $i$, $j$ and $L$, and that the adjunction cannot be generally internalized.
%}

%\niccolo{
%I suggest following the discussion in the introduction and proceed as follows:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The sequent calculus defines a skew monoidal closed category FSkMCC($\mathsf{At}$) with formulae as objects and set of derivations $A \mid ~ \vdash B$ quotiented by $\circeq$ as homset between objects $A$ and $B$. We already mentioned in the previous section the definitions of $\lambda$, $\rho$ and $\alpha$, I am not sure if that discussion should be moved here.
%\item Given a skew monoidal closed category $\mathbb{C}$, every function $F_{\mathsf{At}} : \mathsf{At} \to \mathbb{C}$, giving an interpretation of atomic formulae as objects of $\mathbb{C}$, extends to a skew monoidal closed functor $F :$ FSkMCC$(\mathsf{At}) \to \mathbb{C}$ (then we should give the definition of skew monoidal closed functor beforehand). This shows that skew monoidal closed categories are categorical models of SkNMILL.
%\item FSkMCC($\mathsf{At}$) is the initial model, a.k.a. the free skew monoidal closed category on $\mathsf{At}$. The proof of this calculus is where we should introduce the Hilbert-style calculus (again with a reduced number of rules/equations). Theorem \ref{thm:wkcomplete} is a consequence of point 1 above, i.e. FSkMCC($\mathsf{At}$) is a skew monoidal closed category. Theorem  \ref{thm:sound} instead follows from point 2.
%\end{enumerate}
%}
\begin{defn}\label{def:skewcat}
A \emph{skew monoidal closed category} $\mathbb{C}$ is a category with a unit object $\I$ and two functors $\ot : \mathbb{C} \times \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ and $\lolli : \mathbb{C}^{\mathsf{op}} \times \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ forming an adjunction $- \ot B \dashv B \lolli -$ natural in $B$,
and three natural transfomations %$\lambda$, $\rho$, $\alpha$ with components

The notion of skew monoidal closed category admits other equivalent characterizations \cite{street:skew-closed:2013,uustalu:eilenberg-kelly:2020}. Tuples of natural transformations $(\lambda , \rho , \alpha)$ are in bijective correspondence with tuples
\[
j_A : \I \to A \lolli A \qquad i_A : \I \lolli A \to A \qquad L_{A,B,C} : B \lolli C \to (A \lolli B) \lolli (A \lolli C)
\]
Moreover, $\alpha$ and $L$ are interdefinable with a natural transformation $\mathsf{p}_{A , B , C} : (A \ot B) \lolli C \Longrightarrow A \lolli (B \lolli C)$, representing an internalization of the adjunction between $\ot$ and $\lolli$.


\begin{defn}
  A \emph{(strict) skew monoidal closed functor} $F : \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{D}$ between skew monoidal closed categories $(\mathbb{C} , \I , \ot , \lolli)$ and $(\mathbb{D} , \I' , \ot' , \lolli')$ is a functor from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{D}$ satisfying
%   \begin{align*}
%     F \I \cong \I' \qquad F (C_{1} \ot C_{2}) \cong F C_{1} \ot' F C_{2} \qquad
%     F(C_{1} \lolli C_{2}) \cong F C_{1} \lolli' F C_{2}
%   \end{align*}
%   and preserving strutural laws $\lambda$, $\rho$, and $\alpha$ and .
%   \\
%   A skew monoidal closed functor is strict if
%  \begin{align*}
    $F \I = \I'$, $F (A \ot B) = F A \ot' F B$ and
    $F(A \lolli B) = F A \lolli' F B$, also preserving  strutural laws $\lambda$, $\rho$, and $\alpha$ on the nose.
%  \end{align*}
\end{defn}
%Next we show that given any skew monoidal closed category $\mathbb{C}$ and a function $F_{\mathsf{At}} : \mathsf{At} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ providing interpretation of atomic formulae as objects of $\mathbb{C}$, we can extend function $F_{\mathsf{At}}$ to a skew monoidal closed functor $F : \text{FSkMCC} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$.
%From now on we drop the attribute ``strict''.
\begin{example}
A good example??
\end{example}

The formulae, derivations and equivalence $\circeq$ of the sequent calculus for \SkNMILL\ determine a skew monoidal closed category \FSkMCC($\mathsf{At}$).
\begin{defn}\label{def:fskmcc}
  The skew monoidal closed category \FSkMCC($\mathsf{At}$) has
  objects as formulae, in particular the operations $I$, $\ot$ and $\lolli$ are given by the logical connectives. The set of morphisms between formulae $A$ and $B$ is the set of derivations $A \mid ~ \vdash B$ quotiented by the equivalence relation $\circeq$. The identity morphism is $\ax$, while composition is given by $\mathsf{scut}$. Derivations for the structural laws $\lambda$, $\rho$,$\alpha$ are given in (\ref{eq:lra}). All the equations of skew monoidal closed categories hold wrt. $\circeq$.
\end{defn}

Skew monoidal closed categories correspond precisely to categorical models of \SkNMILL, in the sense specified by the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:models}
  Let $\mathbb{C}$ be a skew monoidal closed category. Given $F_{\mathsf{At}} : \mathsf{At} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ provinding the interpretation of atomic formulae as objects of $\mathbb{C}$, there exists a skew monoidal closed functor $F : \text{\FSkMCC}(\mathsf{At}) \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $(\mathbb{C} , \I' , \ot' , \lolli')$ be a skew monoidal closed category.
  The action on object $F_0$ of the functor $F$ is defined by induction on the input formula:
%  Let $\mathsf{Fma}$ denote the collection of \FSkMCC($\mathsf{At}$) and $\mathbb{C}_{0}$ denote the collection of $\mathbb{C}$, then we can define a mapping $F_{0} : \mathsf{Fma} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}_{0}$
  \begin{equation*}
    F_0X = F_{\mathsf{At}}X
    \qquad
    F_0\I = \I'
    \qquad
    F_0(A \ot B) = F_0A \ot' F_0B
    \qquad
    F_0(A \lolli B) = F_0A \lolli' F_0B
%    F (A)=
%    \begin{cases}
%      F_{\mathsf{At}} (A) &\text{if } A \text{ is atomic}
%      \\
%      \I' &\text{if } A = \I
%      \\
%      F_{\mathsf{At}} (B) \ot' F_{\mathsf{At}} (C) &\text{if } A = B \ot C
%      \\
%      F_{\mathsf{At}} (B) \lolli' F_{\mathsf{At}} (C) &\text{if } A = B \lolli C
%    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  The encoding of antecedents as formulae $\ldbc S \mid \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot}$, introduced immediately after (\ref{eq:inter:ante}), can be replicated also in $\mathbb{C}$ by simply replacing $\ot$ with $\ot'$ in the definition. Using this encoding, it is possible to show that each rule in (\ref{eq:seqcalc}) is derivable in $\mathbb{C}$. As an illustrative case, consider the rule $\pass$. Assume given a morphism $f : \ldbc A \mid \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot'} \to C$ in $\mathbb{C}$. Then, assuming $\Gamma = A_1,\dots,A_n$, we can define the passivation of $f$ as
\[\xymatrixcolsep{7pc}
\xymatrix{
  (\dots ((\I \ot' A_1) \ot' A_2) \dots ) \ot' A_n
  \ar[r]^-{(\dots (\lambda_{A_1} \ot' A_2) \dots ) \ot' A_n} &
  (\dots (A_1 \ot' A_2) \dots ) \ot' A_n
  \ar[r]^-{f} &
  C
}
\]
This implies the existence of a function $F_1$, sending each derivation $f : S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$ to a morphism $F_1f : F_0(\ldbc S \mid \Gamma \rdbc_{\ot}) \to FA$ in $\mathbb{C}$, defined by induction on the last inference rule appearing in the proof tree of $f$. When restricted to sequents of the form $A \mid ~ \vdash B$, the function $F_1$ provides the action on morphisms of $F$.
It is possible to show that $F$ preserves the skew monoidal closed structure on the nose, so it is a skew monoidal closed functor.
%$\mathbb{C}$.
%A \mid \quad \vdash B \to \mathbb{C} (F_{0} (A), F_{0} (B))$
%inductively.  Integrating mapping $F_{0}$ and $F_{1}$, we have a skew
%monoidal closed functor from \FSkMCC($\mathsf{At}$) to $\mathbb{C}$.
%This fact tells us that any skew monoidal closed category is also a
%categorical model of SkMNILL.
\end{proof}

The skew monoidal closed functor $F$ constructed in Theorem \ref{thm:models}, providing the evaluation of all the syntactic constructs in any model $\mathbb{C}$, is in fact unique one for which $F_0 X = F_{\mathsf{At}} X$, for each atomic formula $X$. In other words, the
sequent calculus of Section \ref{sec2} is the \emph{initial} model of \SkNMILL, or, equivalently, \FSkMCC($\mathsf{At}$) is the \emph{free} skew
monoidal closed category on the set $\mathsf{At}$. The uniqueness of $F$ can be proved directly.  Alternatively, following the strategy of our previous papers \cite{}, this can be shown by introducing a Hilbert-style deductive system corresponding to a direct implementation of the free skew monoidal closed category on $\mathsf{At}$. Its formulae are the same of the sequent calculus, its sequents are pairs $A \Longrightarrow B$, with $A$ and $B$ single formulae. Derivations are generated by the following rules, in which it is possible to  recognize all the structure of Definition \ref{def:skewcat}.

There exists a congruence relation $\doteq$ on each set of derivations $A \Longrightarrow B$ with generators directly encoding the equations of the theory of skew monoidal closed categories. With the Hilbert-style calculus in place, one can show that there is a bijection between the set of derivations of the sequent $A \mid ~ \vdash B$ modulo $\circeq$ and the set of derivations of the sequent $A \Longrightarrow B$ modulo $\doteq$.
%The left-to-right function underlying these equivalence is constructible following the receipe specified in Theorem \ref{thm:models}, while the right-to-left function follows from the fact that the Hilbert-style c\FSkMCC($\mathsf{At}$) is a skew monoidal closed category (Definition \ref{def:fskmcc})

%Soundness and completeness among \FSkMCC($\mathsf{At}$)$_{H}$ and \FSkMCC($\mathsf{At}$) is justified because we can prove bijection of derivations (quotiented by $\doteq$ and $\circeq$ respectively) between these two deductive systems by induction on derivations.

\section{Proof-Theoretic Semantics via Focusing}
\label{sec:focus}
The conversion $\circeq$ of Figure \ref{fig:circeq} can also be considered as an abstract rewriting system, by orienting every equation from left to right. The resulting system is weakly confluent and strongly normalizing, thus confleunt with unique normal forms. Therefore derivations in normal forms correspond to canonical representatives of $\circeq$-equivalence classes.
These representatives can be organized in a \emph{focused sequent calculus} \cite{andreoli:logic:1992}, which implements a goal-directed proof search strategy attempting to build a derivation in the (original, unfocused) sequent calculus.

\subsection{A First (Na{\"i}ve) Focused Sequent Calculus}
As a first attempt to focusing, we na{\"i}vely merge together the rules of the focused sequent calculi of skew monoidal (non-closed) categories \cite{uustalu:sequent:2021} and skew prounital (non-monoidal) closed categories \cite{uustalu:deductive:nodate}. In the resulting calculus, sequents have one of 4 possible subscript annotations, corresponding to 4 different phases of proof search: $\RI$ for `right invertible', $\LI$ for `left invertible`, $\Pass$ for `passivation` and $\F$ for `focusing`. We will see soon that this focused calculus is too permissive, in the sense that $\circeq$-related derivations in the sequent calculus (\ref{eq:seqcalc}) have syntactically distinct derivations in the focused system.
%We develop a naive focused calculus according to the framework above and immediately bump into a problem that the naive systme contains too much non-determinacy.
%We will show the naive focused sequent calculus and why too much non-determinacy arises, then fix the problem.
%Derivations in the are generated by the rules

In above rules, the metavariable $P$ denotes a \emph{positive} formula, i.e. $P \not= A \lolli B$, while metavariable $T$ indicates a \emph{negative} stoup, i.e. $T \not= \I$ and $T\not= A \ot B$.

We explain the rules of the focused sequent calculus from the perspective of bottom-up proof search in (\ref{eq:seqcalc}). The starting phase is `right invertible` $\RI$. %We start by analyizing the proof search of a sequent $S \mid \Gamma \vdash_{\RI} C$.
\begin{itemize}
\item[($\vdash_\RI$)] We eagerly apply the right invertible rule $\lright$ with the goal of reducing the succedent to a positive formula $P$.
  %In phase $\bullet$, we keep track of all the formulae moved to the right end of the context by marking them with a black tag $\bullet$.
  When the succedent formula becomes positive, we move to phase $\LI$.
  %keeping the same tag $x$.
\item[($\vdash_\LI$)] We eagerly destruct the stoup formula via application of left invertible rules $\tl$ and $\unitl$ with the goal of making it negative. When this happens we move to phase $\Pass$.
  %keeping the same tag $x$. Notice that  the formula $B$ in the premise of rule $\tl$ does not get marked with a tag.
  %In this phase we do not need to enforce the order between $\unitl$ and $\tl$ applicaitons because they are not exchangeable.
\item[($\vdash_\Pass$)] We have the possibility of applying the passivation rule and move the leftmost formula $A$ in the context to the stoup, when the latter is empty. This allow us to start decomposing $A$ using left invertible rules in phase $\LI$. Otherwise we move to phase $\F$.
%  where only $\pass$ can be applied to sequents.
%  Notice that for the active formula in each application of $\pass$, we remove its tag and the sequent goes back to phase $\LI$ to decompose stoup formula again because the passviated formula $A$ could be reducible.
\item[($\vdash_\F$)] We apply one of the four remaining rules $\ax$, $\unitr$, $\tr$ or $\lleft$. The premises of $\tr$ are both in phase $\RI$ since $A$ and $B$ are generic formulae, in particular they could be implications. The first premise of $\lleft$ is in phase $\RI$ for the same reason, while the second premise is in $\LI$ because the succedent formula $P$ is positive.
\end{itemize}

The focused sequent calculus in (\ref{eq:naive}) is sound and complete wrt. the sequent calculus in (\ref{eq:seqcalc}), but not \emph{equationally complete}, i.e. there exist $\circeq$-related derivations in (\ref{eq:seqcalc}) which have multiple distinct derivations in (\ref{eq:naive}). In other words, the calculus in (\ref{eq:naive}) is too permissive. There are in fact two forms on nondeterminism that can arise:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first premise of the $\tr$ rule is in phase $\RI$, since $A$ is potentially an implication on which the invertible right rule $\lright$ could act upon. Proof search on the first premise eventually hits phase $\Pass$, when we have the possibility of applying the $\pass$ rule if the stoup is empty. This implies the existence of situations where either of the rules $\tr$ and $\pass$ can be applied first, in both cases resulting in valid focused derivations. The congruence relation $\circeq$ eliminates this form of nondeterminism via the 4th equation in Figure \ref{fig:circeq}, i.e. the permutative conversion involving $\tr$ and $\pass$.
%  The other occurs when we decompose $\ot$ in succedent, left premise goes back to phase $\RI$, so if the left premise of $\tr$ application is empty, then $\pass$ could be applied in phase $\Pass$.
  Consider the two distinct derivations of $- \mid X , \Gamma , \Delta \vdash_{\Pass} P \ot C$ under assumptions $f : X \mid \Gamma \vdash_{\LI} P$ and $g : - \mid \Delta \vdash_{\RI} C$.

    %  \quad

            &
            \deduce{- \mid \Delta \vdash_{\RI} C}{g}
          }
        }
      }

    \qquad
%    \proofbox{

      }
    }
    }

%  }
  \end{equation}
  The rule $\mathsf{sw}$ is a sequence of (appropriately typed) phase
  switching rules $\LI2\RI$, $\Pass2\LI$ and $\F2\Pass$.
  \item Rules $\tr$ and $\lleft$ appear in the same phase $\F$, though there are situations where both rules can be applied first, which can lead to two valid but distinct focused derivations. More precisely, there are cases when $\tr$ and $\lleft$ can be interchangeably applied. This form of nondeterminism is tamed in the congruence relation $\circeq$ by the last permutative conversion in Figure \ref{fig:circeq}, involving $\tr$ and $\lleft$. As an example, consider the following two valid derivations of $A \lolli X \mid \Gamma , \Delta , \Lambda \vdash_{\F} P \ot D$ under the assumption of $f : - \mid \Gamma \vdash_{\RI} A$, $g : X \mid \Delta \vdash_{\LI} P$ and $h : - \mid \Lambda \vdash_{\RI} D$.
%  In this case $\tr$ and $\lleft$ rule applications are interchangeable.
%  For convenience, we define an abbreviation of consecutive phase switching rule applications under suitable condition
%  \begin{displaymath}
%    \infer[\mathsf{sw}]{S \mid \Gamma \vdash_{ph} C}{S \mid \Gamma \vdash_{ph} C}
%  \end{displaymath}
%  then we can see how the non-determinacy arises.
  %Without loose of generality, we assume $\Gamma, \Delta$, and $\Lambda$ are sufficient and necessary in proving each sequent respectively.
  %In tagged focused calculus, such exchangeable situation would not happen.
%  Given a sequent $A \lolli B \mid \Gamma , \Delta , \Lambda \vdash_{\RI} C \ot D$ and supposed that $B$ is negative and $C$ is positive, then
%  we can do a bottom-up proof search according to our naive focused sequent calculus:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:llefttr}
      \hspace{-.5cm}
      \proofbox{
%    \infer[\mathsf{sw}]{A \lolli X \mid \Gamma , \Delta , \Lambda \vdash_{\RI} P \ot D}{
      \infer[\lleft]{A \lolli X \mid \Gamma , \Delta , \Lambda \vdash_{\F} P \ot D}{
        \deduce{- \mid \Gamma \vdash_{\RI} A}{f}
        &\hspace{-.6cm}
        \infer[\mathsf{sw}]{X \mid \Delta , \Lambda \vdash_{\LI} P \ot D}{
          \infer[\tr]{X \mid \Delta , \Lambda \vdash_{\F} P\ot D}{
            \infer[\mathsf{sw}]{X \mid \Delta \vdash_{\RI} P}{
              \deduce{X \mid \Delta \vdash_{\LI} P}{g}
            }
            &
            \deduce{- \mid \Lambda \vdash_{\RI} D}{h}
          }
        }
      }
%    }
%    }
      \hspace{.2cm}
%    \quad
%  \end{displaymath}
%  However, there is another proof of for $A \lolli B \mid \Gamma , \Delta , \Lambda \vdash_{\RI} C \ot D$
    %  \begin{displaymath}
%    \proofbox{
%    \infer[\mathsf{sw}]{A \lolli X \mid \Gamma , \Delta , \Lambda \vdash_{\RI} P\ot D}{
      \infer[\tr]{A \lolli X \mid \Gamma , \Delta , \Lambda \vdash_{\F} P \ot D}{
        \infer[\mathsf{sw}]{A \lolli X \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vdash_{\RI} P}{
          \infer[\lleft]{A \lolli X \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vdash_{\F} P}{
            \deduce{- \mid \Gamma \vdash_{\RI} A}{f}
            &
            \deduce{X \mid \Delta \vdash_{\LI} P}{g}
          }
        }
        &\hspace{-.6cm}
        \deduce{- \mid \Lambda \vdash_{\RI} D}{h}
      }
    }
%    }
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

%In summary, two counter-example above show that our naive focused sequent calculus contains too much non-determinacy.

An impulsive idea for solving the nondeterminism of type 2 is to prioritize the application of $\lleft$ over $\tr$, e.g. by forcing the application of $\lleft$ in phase $\F$ whenever the stoup formula is an implication and restricting the application of $\tr$ to sequents where the stoup formula is atomic. This idea would lead to an unsound calculus, since the sequent $X \lolli Y \mid Z \vdash_{\F} (X \lolli Y) \ot Z$, which has a valid correspondent in (\ref{eq:seqcalc}), would not be provable by first applying the $\lleft$ rule.
Dually, prioritizing the application of $\tr$ over $\lleft$ leads to similar issues, e.g. the sequent $X \lolli (Y \ot Z) \mid X \vdash_\F Y \ot Z$ would not be derivable by first applying the $\tr$ rule.

%It seems can eliminate non-determinacy but a new problem occurs.
%Some provable sequents in \SkNMILL \text{ } become non-provable in focused system.
%
%For example, consider seqeunt $X \lolli Y \mid Z \vdash_{\RI} (X \lolli Y) \ot Z$ when we favor $\lleft$ than $\tr$.
%\begin{displaymath}
%  \infer[\mathsf{sw}]{X \lolli Y \mid Z \vdash_{\RI} (X \lolli Y) \ot Z}{
%    \infer[\lleft]{X \lolli Y \mid Z \vdash_{\F} (X \lolli Y) \ot Z}{
%      \deduce{- \mid \quad \vdash_{\RI} X}{??}
%      &
%      \infer[\mathsf{sw}]{Y \mid Z \vdash_{\LI} (X \lolli Y) \ot Z}{
%        \infer[\tr]{Y \mid Z \vdash_{\F} (X \lolli Y) \ot Z}{
%          \infer[\lright]{Y \mid \quad \vdash_{\RI} X \lolli Y}{
%            \deduce{Y \mid X \vdash_{\RI} Y}{??}
%          }
%          &
%          \infer[\mathsf{sw}]{- \mid Z \vdash_{\RI} Z}{
%            \infer[\pass]{- \mid Z \vdash_{\Pass} Z}{
%              \infer[\mathsf{sw}]{Z \mid \quad \vdash_{\LI} Z}{
%                \infer[\ax]{Z \mid \quad \vdash_{\F} Z}{}
%              }
%            }
%          }
%        }
%      }
%    }
%  }
%\end{displaymath}
%It fails to find a proof of $X \lolli Y \mid Z \vdash_{\RI} (X \lolli Y) \ot Z$ because we don't have a rule to prove $- \mid \quad \vdash_{\RI} X$ when $X$ is atomic.
%We also could not prove sequent $Y \mid X \vdash_{\RI} Y$ since there is no primitive or admissible left weakening rule in our system.
%The problem in quick solution of case 1 arises when there are some stoup related formulae packed in succedent.
%If we insist to decompose stoup before succedent then it is impossible to finish proof search.
%The other way around is similar, i.e. some succedent related formulae are packed in stoup.

\subsection{A Tagged Focused System}\label{sec:tag}

%However, solution for case 2 inspires us to come up with a uniform solution.
In order to eliminate the nondeterminism of type 1 between $\pass$ and $\tr$, we need to restrict the possible application of $\pass$ occurring after the application of $\tr$. 
One way to achieve this is by forcing such application of $\pass$ to move the leftmost formula to the stoup only if such formula occurrence is \emph{new}, in the sense that it was not already present in the context before the first $\tr$ application. For example, with this restriction in place, the application of $\pass$ in the 2nd derivation of (\ref{eq:passtr}) would be invalid, since the formula $X$ was already present in context before the application of $\tr$.

Analogously, the nondeterminism of type 2 between $\lleft$ and $\tr$ can be eliminated by restricting the possible application of $\lleft$ occurring after the application of $\tr$. This can be achieved by forcing such application of $\lleft$ to split the context in two parts $\Gamma,\Delta$ in such a way that $\Gamma$, i.e. the context of the first premise, must contain some \emph{new} formula not occurring in the context before the first $\tr$ application. Under this restriction, the application of $\lleft$ in the 2nd derivation of (\ref{eq:llefttr}) would become invalid, since all formulae in $\Gamma$ are already present in context before the application of $\tr$.

One way to distinguish between old and new formulae occurrences in the above cases is by marking with a \emph{tag} $\bullet$ each new formula appearing in context during the building of a focused derivation. We christen a formula occurrence ``new'' whenever it is moved from the succedent to the context via an application of the right implication rule $\lright$. In order to remember when we are building a derivation of a sequent arising as the first premise of $\tr$, in which the distinction between old and new formula is relevant, we mark such sequents with a tag $\bullet$ as well.
%In other words, the first premise of  $\tr$ in (\ref{eq:naive}) would be replace by a sequent $T \mid \Gamma \vdash_\RI^\bullet A$
%In the complicated focused system, sequents can also potentially be annotated with an extra superscript annotation $\bullet$, called a \emph{tag}. Tags are a technical mechanism for keeping track of new formulae appearing in the context after the application of the right implication rule. This, as we will thorougly discuss later, allows to control the reduction of nondeterministic choices during proof search, in particular resolving the possible choices arising from the permutative conversions of Figure \ref{fig:circeq}.
More generally, we write $S \mid \Gamma \xvdash_{ph} C$ for a sequent that can potentially be tagged, i.e. the turnstile could be of the form $\vdash_{ph}^{\bullet}$ or $\vdash_{ph}$, for all $ph \in \{ \RI,\LI,\Pass,\F\}$. This implies that there are a total of 8 sequent phases, corresponding to the possible combinations of 4 subscript phases with the tagged/untagged state.
%A tag can either be \emph{black} $\bullet$, with corresponding turnstile symbol $\vdash_{ph}^{\bullet}$, or \emph{white} $\circ$, in which case we write $\vdash_{ph}^\circ$ or simply $\vdash_{ph}$, where $ph \in \{ \RI,\LI,\Pass,\F\}$. This implies that there are a total of 8 sequent phases, corresponding to the possible combinations of 4 subscript phases with the 2 tags.
In tagged sequents  $S \mid \Gamma \vdash_{ph}^{\bullet} C$, formulae in the context $\Gamma$ are also allowed to be tagged, i.e. they can be of the form $A^\bullet$ or $A$. Given a context $\Gamma$ containing possibly tagged formulae, we write $\Gamma^{\circ}$ for the same context where all the black tags have been removed from formulae. All formulae in a untagged sequent $S \mid \Gamma \vdash_{ph} C$ are tag-free.

The side condition in rule $\lleft$ reads: if $x = \bullet$, there exists an occurrence of a tagged formula $D^\bullet$ in $\Gamma$.
%The side condition in rule $\F 2\Pass$ reads: if the stoup $T$ is empty or an atomic formula, then $y$ is empty, i.e. the premise is sequent $T \mid \Gamma \vdash P$; if $T$ is an implication, then $y = x$.

%We explain the rules of the focused sequent calculus from the perspective of bottom-up proof search. We start by analyizing the proof search of an untagged sequent $S \mid \Gamma \vdash_{\RI} C$, by pretending that the tag annotations are not present and forgetting about all the side conditions related to tags.
%One important thing is that even though we have tagged suquents in a proof, but the end sequent should keep tag free.

The rules in (\ref{eq:focus}), when stripped of all the tags, are equivalent to the rules in the na{\"i}ve calculus (\ref{eq:naive}). When building a derivation of an untagged sequent $S \mid \Gamma \vdash_\RI A$, the only possible way to enter the black $\bullet$ phase is via an application of the $\tr$ rule, so that sequents with turnstile marked $\vdash_{ph}^\bullet$ denote the fact that we are performing proof search in the first premise of $\tr$.
In black phase, the search for a proof of $T \mid \Gamma^\circ \vdash^\bullet_\RI A$ proceeds as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[($\vdash^\bullet_\RI$)] We eagerly apply the right invertible rule $\lright$ with the goal of reducing $A$ to a positive formula $P$. All the formulae moved to the right end of the context are ``new'', and therefore are marking with a black tag $\bullet$.
  When the succedent formula becomes positive, we move to black $\LI$ phase.
  %keeping the same tag $x$.
\item[($\vdash^\bullet_\LI$)] Since $T$ is a negative stoup, we can only move to the black $\Pass$ phase.
  %keeping the same tag $x$. Notice that  the formula $B$ in the premise of rule $\tl$ does not get marked with a tag.
  %In this phase we do not need to enforce the order between $\unitl$ and $\tl$ applicaitons because they are not exchangeable.
\item[($\vdash^\bullet_\Pass$)] We have the possibility of applying the $\pass$ rule and move the leftmost formula $A$ in the context to the stoup, but only when this formula is marked by a black tag $\bullet$. This restriction makes it possible to remove nondeterminism of type 1. Afterwards, we strip the context of all tags and jump to untagged $\LI$ phase. If we do not (or cannot) apply $\pass$, we move to phase $\F$  in two different ways, depending on the status of $T$. If $T$ is either empty or atomic, we strip the context of the tags and move to untagged $\F$ phase. If $T$ is an implication, we move to black $\F$ phase. In the latter case, the tags are preserved for restricting the future possible applications of $\lleft$.
\item[($\vdash^\bullet_\F$)] We can apply only $\tr$ or $\lleft$. If we apply $\tr$, we remove all tags from the context $\Gamma$ and move the first premise to black $\RI$ phase again. The tags are removed from the contexts in order to not mix the tagged formulae that have appeared in context so far with the ``new'' formulae that may appear in the future. The most interesting case is $\lleft$, which can only be applied if $\Gamma$ contains at least one tagged formula. This side condition implements the restriction allowing the elimination of nondeterminism of type 2. All the premises of $\lleft$ are stripped of their tags.
\end{itemize}

%In this sense, we can add some marks on left premise of $\tr$ applications.
%Specifically, the left premise goes to a special black phase where sequents can also potentially be annotated with an extra superscript annotation $\bullet$, called a \emph{tag}. Tags are a technical mechanism for keeping track of new formulae appearing in the context after the application of the right implication rule.
%Under this tag setting $\pass$ can be applied only if the passivated formula is tagged, which means that it comes from $\lright$ docomposition.
%In particular, it means that the passivated formula was packed in succedent in previous $\tr$ decomposition which is an analogous situation of case 1.
%Accoding to this setting, we can prioritize $\lleft$ than $\tr$ and keep provability.
%We achieve this goal by restricting the $\lleft$ applications in black phase.
%Specifically, we can decompose $\lleft$ in black phase only if there is some black formula in left context $\Gamma$ (means that $\Gamma$ goes to left premise after decomposition).
%Under this framework, we prioritize $\lleft$ than $\tr$ to eliminate non-determinacy but also keep provablity of our focused system.


%Since both rules $\tr$ and $\lleft$ appear in the same phase $\F$, and both rules can be applicable in some cases (see the last equation in Figure \ref{fig:circeq}.
%  Here we have special resrictions on $\tl$ and $\lleft$.
%  In general, we prefer to decompose $\lolli$ in stoup prior then $\ot$ in conclusion.
%  However, if there are some formula are packed into conclusion, then whole bottom-up proof strategy fails.
%  We will see comparison between involved and naive focused system later.
%  For rule $\tr$, we let its left and right premises back to phase $\RI$ because $A$ and $B$ could be negative formulas.
%  Especially, the left premise becomes a tagged sequent.
%  In a $\lleft$ application, if conclusion sequent is tagged, then at least exists a formula $F$ is black in the context of left premise.
%  Remembering that we prefer $\lleft$ prior to $\tr$, so if there is any $\tr$ before $\lleft$, then we have to ensure that we cannot do $\lleft$ first.
%  Black tags produced by $\lright$ play essential roles here because if there is no black formula in $\Gamma$, then it implies that we cannot do $\lleft$ after $\tr$.
%  In this situation, we must decompose $\lolli$ in stoup prior than $\ot$ in conclusion.

The tagged focused system solves the two types of nondeterminism without losing provablity. For example, only one of the two derivations in (\ref{eq:passtr}) is valid using the rules in (\ref{eq:focus}), and similarly for (\ref{eq:llefttr})
%is valid using the rules in (\ref{eq:focus}), removing nondeterminism of type 2:
%removing nondeterminism of type 1:

%  However, the other way around(decompose $\ot$ prior to $\lolli$) is impossible.

%  The situation is worse if $C$ is positive, we cannot produce tags from $\lright$ application to ensure applicability of $\lleft$, so the whole derivation gets stuck and cannont close.

 The extra restriction on sequents and formulae imposed on the rules in (\ref{eq:focus}) do not reduce provability, e.g. sequents $X \lolli Y \mid Z \vdash_{\RI} (X \lolli Y) \ot Z$, whose proof requires the application of $\tr$ before $\lleft$, and $X \lolli (Y \ot Z) \mid X \vdash_\F Y \ot Z$, where $\lleft$ must appear below $\tr$ in the proof tree, are both derivable.

%This fact shows that in tagged focused system, we cannot permute $\tr$ and $\lleft$ applications arbitrarily.
%In this sense, two equivalent proofs in \SkNMILL\ become identical in focused calculus.
 Moreover, the tagged focused sequent calculus is sound and complete wrt. the  sequent calculus of Section \ref{sec2}.
Soundness is immediate: there exist functions $\mathsf{emb}_{ph} : S \mid \Gamma \vdash^x_{ph} A \to S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$, for all $ph \in \{\RI,\LI,\Pass, \F \}$, which simply erases all phase annotations and tags. Completeness follows from the fact that the following rules are all admissibile: % here not only can prove every sequent in \SkNMILL (\SkNMILL and tagged focused system are equivalent) but also without producing redundant non-determinacy.
%Moreover, not only $\tr$ and $\lleft$ equivalent case becomes identical in focused system, but any other equivalent cases hold the same fact.
%We can substantiate equivalence between \SkNMILL and tagged focused calculus by following results.

      &
      - \mid \Delta \vdash_{\RI} B
    }
  \end{array}
\end{equation}
%\end{lemma}
The interesting one is $\tr_{\Gamma'}^{\RI}$. The tensor right rule $\tr^\RI$, with premises and conclusion in phase $\RI$, is derivable from the latter by taking an empty $\Gamma'$. 
Without this generalization including the extra context $\Gamma'$, one quickly discovers that finding a proof of $\tr^\RI$, proceeding by induction on the structure of the derivation of the first premise, is not possible when this derivation ends with an application of $\lright$:
%The generalization is necessary for making the inductive hypothesis strong enough and make our proof smoothly.
%For example, considering following proof tree, if we invoke simple version of $\tr$ in phase $\RI$, then we cannot proof its admissibility:
\begin{displaymath}
  \proofbox{
    \infer[\tr^{\RI}]{S \mid \Gamma , \Delta \vdash_{\RI} (A' \lolli B') \ot B}{
    \infer[\lright]{S \mid \Gamma \vdash_{\RI} A' \lolli B'}{
      \deduce{S \mid \Gamma , A' \vdash_{\RI} B'}{f}
    }
    &
    \deduce{- \mid \Delta \vdash_{\RI} B}{g}
    }
    } = \quad ??
\end{displaymath}
The inductive hypothesis applied to $f$ and $g$ would produce a derivation of the wrong sequent. The use of $\Gamma'$ in the generalized rule $\tr_{\Gamma'}^{\RI}$ is there to fix precisely this issue.
%In this case, we cannot permute $\tr^{\RI}_s$ up to use inductive hypothesis.
%Therefore we need to have a stronger version of $\tr$ which performs $\tr$ and $\lright$ in the same time.
%There is no generality loss because we can always take $\Gamma'$ as empty then reduce to simple $\tr$.

The admissibility of the rules in \ref{eq:admis} allows the construction of a function $\mathsf{focus} : S \mid \Gamma \vdash A \to S \mid \Gamma \vdash_\RI A$, transforming each rule in (\ref{eq:seqcalc}) to the corresponding focused rule in phase $\RI$.
%satisfying $\mathsf{focus}\;f = \mathsf{focus}\;g$ whenever $f \circeq g$. In turns, the existence of such function $\mathsf{focus}$ is equivalent to the
%On the other hand, we can define a function $\mathsf{focus}$ to map each derivation in cut-free sequent calculus to a derivaiton in focused calculus because lemma \ref{AdmissibleInRI} holds.
%Specifically, for each derivation in cut-free sequent calculus, function $\mathsf{focus}$ adds phase label $\RI$ on $\vdash$ and rename each rule into its $\RI$ version.
It is possible to prove that the function $\mathsf{focus}$ maps  $\circeq$-equivalent derivations in the sequent calculus for \SkNMILL\ to syntactically identical derivations in focused seqeunt calculus. Moreover, one can also show that $\mathsf{focus}$ is the inverse of $\mathsf{emb}_\RI$, i.e. $\mathsf{focus}\;(\mathsf{emb}_\RI \;f) = f$ for all $f : S \mid \Gamma \vdash_\RI A$ and $\mathsf{emb}_\RI\;(\mathsf{focus}\;g) \circeq g$ for all $g : S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$. In other words, each $\circeq$-equivalence class in the sequent calculus corresponds uniquely to a single derivation in the focused sequent calculus.

The focused sequent calculus solves the \emph{coherence problem} for skew monoidal closed categories.
As proved in Section \ref{sec:catsem}, the sequent calculus for \SkNMILL\ has an underlying category $\FSkMCC(\mathsf{At})$, which is the \emph{free} skew monoidal closed category on the set $\mathsf{At}$. Solving the coherence problem then corresponds to decide whether two parallel morphisms in $\FSkMCC(\mathsf{At})$ are equal wrt. the equational theory of skew monoidal closed categories. The latter problem is in turns equivalent to decide whether two derivations $f,g : S \mid \Gamma \vdash A$ are in the same $\circeq$-equivalence class. But this is the same as deciding whether $\mathsf{focus}\;f = \mathsf{focus}\;g$ in the focused sequent calculus, and deciding syntactic equality of focused derivations is a simple task.

%ies, so we can construct an effective procedure to determine equivalence of morphisms in a free skew monoidal closed category.
%Given two parallel morphisms in a category composed exclusively of of commutativity of diagrams of canonical morphisms 
%Therefore, deciding two proofs to be equivalent could be done by checking whether their corresponding focused derivation are identical.
%Next, we can extend this result to decide equality of morphisms in skew monoidal closed categories.

%We take one more step to extend the results to categorical side.
%According to categorical semantics section above, we know \SkNMILL\ is sound and complete with free skew monoidal categories, so we can construct an effective procedure to determine equivalence of morphisms in a free skew monoidal closed category.
