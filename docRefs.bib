A standard-style sequent calculus for this logic is easily obtained by extending multiple-conclusion sequent calculus for intuitionistic logic with exclusion rules dual to the implication rules (in particular, the exclusion-left rule restricts the premise to be single-assumption). However, similarly to standard-style sequent calculi for non-classical logics like S5, this calculus is incomplete without the cut rule. Motivated by the problem of proof search for propositional bi-intuitionistic logic ({BiInt}), various cut-free calculi with extended sequents have been proposed, including (i) a calculus of nested sequents by Goré et al., which includes rules for creation and removal of nests (called ‘nest rules’, resp. ‘unnest rules’) and (ii) a calculus of labelled sequents by the authors, derived from the Kripke semantics of {BiInt}, which includes ‘monotonicity rules’ to propagate truth/falsehood between accessible worlds.},

We dissect the proof of this theorem and observe that the necessity for a side condition on closedness arises because the standard definition of closed category is left-skew in regards to associativity. We analyze Street's observation that left-skew monoidality is equivalent to left-skew closedness and establish that monoidality is equivalent to closedness unconditionally under an adjusted definition of closedness that requires normal associativity. We also work out a definition of right-skew closedness equivalent to right-skew monoidality. We give examples of each type of structure; in particular, we look at the Kleisli category of a left-strong monad on a left-skew closed category and the Kleisli category of a lax closed monad on a right-skew closed category. We also view skew and normal monoidal and closed categories as special cases of skew and normal promonoidal categories and take a brief look at left-skew prounital-closed categories.},

The second system is the symmetric completion of the ﬁrst, as normally given in deep inference for logics with a {DeMorgan} duality: all inference rules have duals, as cut is dual to the identity axiom. We prove a generalisation of cut elimination, that we call symmetric normalisation, where all rules dual to standard ones are permuted up in the derivation. The result is a decomposition theorem having cut elimination and interpolation as corollaries.},

The main source of non-locality is the contraction rules. We show that the contraction rules can be restricted to the atomic ones, provided we employ deep-inference, i.e., to allow rules to apply anywhere inside logical expressions. We further show that the use of deep inference allows for modular extensions of intuitionistic logic to Dummett’s intermediate logic {LC}, G¨odel logic and classical logic. We present the systems in the calculus of structures, a proof theoretic formalism which supports deep-inference. Cut elimination for these systems are proved indirectly by simulating the cut-free sequent systems, or the hypersequent systems in the cases of Dummett’s {LC} and G¨odel logic, in the cut free systems in the calculus of structures.},

The starting point for this research line is the multiplicative fragment of linear logic, for which a simple focused proof system can be built.},

The consequence is that we lose the tree structure of the formulas corresponding to the cographs. Therefore we cannot use standard proof theoretical methods that depend on that tree structure. In order to overcome this difficulty, we use a modular decomposition of graphs and some techniques from deep inference where inference rules do not rely on the main connective of a formula. For our proof system we show the admissibility of cut and a generalization of the splitting property. Finally, we show that our system is a conservative extension of multiplicative linear logic ({MLL}) with mix, meaning that if a graph is a cograph and provable in our system, then it is also provable in {MLL}+mix.},

Bar induction was originally proposed by Brouwer as an axiom to recover certain classically valid theorems in a constructive setting. It is a form of induction on non-wellfounded trees satisfying certain properties. Bar recursion, introduced later by Spector, is the corresponding function definition principle.We give a generalization of these principles, by introducing the notion of barred coalgebra: a process with a branching behaviour given by a functor, such that all possible computations terminate.Coalgebraic bar recursion is the statement that every barred coalgebra is recursive; a recursive coalgebra is one that allows definition of functions by a coalgebra-to-algebra morphism. It is a framework to characterize valid forms of recursion for terminating functional programs. One application of the principle is the tabulation of continuous functions: Ghani, Hancock and Pattinson defined a type of wellfounded trees that represent continuous functions on streams. Bar recursion allows us to prove that every stably continuous function can be tabulated to such a tree, where by stability we mean that the modulus of continuity is its own modulus. Coalgebraic bar induction states that every barred coalgebra is wellfounded; a wellfounded coalgebra is one that admits proof by induction.},

For an inference to be legitimate in a proof it must have sufficient epistemic power, so that the proof really justifies its final conclusion. However, the epistemic concepts used to account for this power are in their turn usually explained in terms of the concept of proof. To get out of this circle we may consider an idea within intuitionism about what it is to justify the assertion of a proposition. It depends on Heyting’s view of the meaning of a proposition, but does not presuppose the concept of inference or of proof as chains of inferences. I discuss this idea and what is required in order to use it for an adequate notion of valid inference.},

This accounting is made possible by removing the ‘structural’ rules of contraction and weakening, adding a modal operator and adding finer versions of the propositional connectives. Linear logic has fundamental logical interest and applications to computer science, particularly to Petri nets, concurrency, storage allocation, garbage collection and the control structure of logic programs. In addition, there is a direct correspondence between polynomial-time computation and proof normalization in a bounded form of linear logic. In this paper we show that unlike most other propositional (quantifier-free) logics, full propositional linear logic is undecidable. Further, we prove that without the modal storage operator, which indicates unboundedness of resources, the decision problem becomes {PSPACE}-complete. We also establish membership in {NP} for the multiplicative fragment, {NP}-completeness for the multiplicative fragment extended with unrestricted weakening, and undecidability for fragments of noncommutative propositional linear logic.},

A basic normal modal intuitionistic affine logic ({BIAL}) and its normal extensions are also defined, and the completeness theorems for these logics are proved with respect to Kripke semantics. In the proposed semantic framework of these normal extensions, a simple correspondence can be given between frame conditions and Lemmon–Scott axioms. A dynamic intuitionistic affine logic ({DIAL}) is proposed as an affine version of (test-free) dynamic logic, and the completeness theorem for this logic is shown with respect to Kripke semantics. Finally, some intuitive interpretations, such as resource and informational interpretations, are given for the proposed logics and semantics. By using these logics, semantics and interpretations, various kinds of fine-grained resource-sensitive reasoning can be expressed.},

Modal logic has proved to be suitable for this purpose. So far, most approaches have presented a language to describe only deterministic coalgebras. The present paper introduces a generalization that also covers non-deterministic systems. Models for our modal language are F-coalgebras where the functor F is inductively constructed from constant sets and the identity functor using product, coproduct, exponentiation, and the power set functor. Thus, Kripke-structures constitute a special case. First we introduce a language that is based on a multisorted modal setting: here the sorts are given by the subfunctors of F. Then we consider a restricted language that still has the same expressiveness. It turns out that, for the case of Kripke-structures, the obtained language is equivalent to the “usual” modal logic for these structures. Hence this approach actually constitutes a bridge between modal languages for coalgebras and the modal logic for Kripke-structures. A well-known result from modal logic can be transfered to our setting: for so-called image-finite coalgebras bisimilarity coincides with logical equivalence. Finally, we present a sound and complete deduction calculus in case the constants in F are finite.},

Thus, the adjoint functors allow one to pull the exchange structural rule from the left side to the right side.

This means that formulae in such frameworks can only be organised as sets and multisets of formulae not being possible to organise formulae as lists of formulae. This paper investigates the proof theory of linear logic proof systems in the non-commutative variant. These systems can disallow the application of exchange rule on some subexponentials. We investigate conditions for when cut elimination is admissible in the presence of non-commutative subexponentials, investigating the interaction of the exchange rule with the local and non-local contraction rules.

Girard's “linear logic” [4], and certain models for the logic of quantum mechanics, namely Mulvey's “quantales” [9]. This will be done not only in the case of commutative linear logic, but also in the case of a version of noncommutative linear logic suggested, but not fully formalized, by Girard in lectures given at {McGill} University in the fall of 1987 [5], and which for reasons which will become clear later we call “cyclic linear logic”.For many of our results on quantales, we rely on the work of Niefield and Rosenthal [10].The reader should note that by “the logic of quantum mechanics” we do not mean the lattice theoretic “quantum logics” of Birkhoff and von Neumann [1], but rather a logic involving an associative (in general noncommutative) operation “and then”. Logical validity is intended to embody empirical verification (whether a physical experiment, or running a program), and the validity of A \& B (in Mulvey's notation) is to be regarded as “we have verified A, and then we have verified B”. (See M. D. Srinivas [11] for another exposition of this idea.)This of course is precisely the view of the “multiplicative conjunction”, ⊗, in the phase semantics for Girard's linear logic [4], [5]. Indeed the quantale semantics for linear logic may be regarded as an element-free version of the phase semantics.},

To overcome this problem, a subclass of proofs, called the ‘focusing’ proofs, which is both complete (any derivable formla in linear logic has a focusing proof) and tractable (many irrelevant choices in the search are eliminated when aimed at focusing proofs) is identified. The main constraint underlying the specificatuon of focusing proofs has been to preserve the symmetry of linear logic, which is its most salient feature. In particular, dual connectives have dual properties with respect to focusing {proofsThen}, a progrmming language, called {LinLog}, consisting of a fragment of linear logic, in which focussing proofs have a more compact form, is presented. Linlog deals with formulae which have a syntax similar to the of the definite clauses and goals of Horn logic, but the crucial difference here is that it allows clauses with multiple atoms in the head, connected by the ‘par’ (multiplicative disjuction). It is then shown that the syntyactic restriction induced by {LinLog} is not performed at the cost of any expressive power: a mapping from full linear logic to {LinLog}, preserving focusing proofs, and analogous to the normalization to clausal form for classical logic, is presented.},

Many existing structures can be represented as {LNL} polycategories, including {LNL} adjunctions, linear exponential comonads, {LNL} multicategories, {IL}-indexed categories, linearly distributive categories with storage, commutative and strong monads, {CBPV}-structures, models of polarized calculi, skew multicategories, as well as ordinary cartesian and symmetric multicategories and monoidal categories, polycategories, and linearly distributive and *-autonomous categories. To study such classes of structures uniformly, we define a notion of {LNL} doctrine, such that each of these classes of structures can be identified with the algebras for some such doctrine. We show that free algebras for {LNL} doctrines can be presented by a sequent calculus, and that every morphism of doctrines induces an adjunction between their 2-categories of algebras.},

In this paper we study the structural proof theory of symmetric skew monoidal categories, progressing the project initiated by Uustalu et al. on deductive systems for categories with skew structure. We discuss three equivalent presentations of the free symmetric skew monoidal category on a set of generating objects: a Hilbert-style categorical calculus; a cut-free sequent calculus; a focused subsystem of derivations, corresponding to a sound and complete goal-directed proof search strategy for the cut-free sequent calculus. Focusing defines an effective normalization procedure for maps in the free symmetric skew monoidal category, as such solving the coherence problem for symmetric skew monoidal categories.},

	abstract = {Kornel Szlach{\textbackslash}'anyi recently used the term skew-monoidal category for a particular laxified version of monoidal category. He showed that bialgebroids \$H\$ with base ring \$R\$ could be characterized in terms of skew-monoidal structures on the category of one-sided \$R\$-modules for which the lax unit was \$R\$ itself. We define skew monoidales (or skew pseudo-monoids) in any monoidal bicategory \${\textbackslash}mathscr M\$. These are skew-monoidal categories when \${\textbackslash}mathscr M\$ is \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Cat\}\$. Our main results are presented at the level of monoidal bicategories. However, a consequence is that quantum categories in the sense of Day-Street with base comonoid \$C\$ in a suitably complete braided monoidal category \${\textbackslash}mathscr V\$ are precisely skew monoidales in \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Comod\} ({\textbackslash}mathscr V)\$ with unit coming from the counit of \$C\$. Quantum groupoids are those skew monoidales with invertible associativity constraint. In fact, we provide some very general results connecting opmonoidal monads and skew monoidales. We use a lax version of the concept of warping defined recently by Booker-Street to modify monoidal structures.},
